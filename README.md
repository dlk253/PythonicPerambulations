OBSOLETE source for Pythonic Perambulations
-------------------------------------------

This was the original source of my [Pythonic Perambulations](http://jakevdp.github.io)
blog,built using the [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) blogging platform.
See http://github.com/jakevdp/jakevdp.github.io-source/ for the current version

Requirements
------------

- Recent version of [IPython](http://github.com/ipython/ipython).  The
  liquid_tags plugin above requires IPython 1.0.  Note that previously
  this could be built with the stand-alone nbconvert package.  That
  no longer works with the recent liquid_tags plugin.

- Recent version of [Pelican](http://github.com/getpelican/pelican).  For
  the static paths (downloads, images, figures, etc.) to appear in the right
  place, Pelican 3.3+ must be used.
